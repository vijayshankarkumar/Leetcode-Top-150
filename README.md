# Leetcode Top 150

#### 1. 88. Merge Sorted Array

You are given two integer arrays nums1 and nums2, sorted in non-decreasing order, and two integers m and n, representing the number of elements in nums1 and nums2 respectively.

Merge nums1 and nums2 into a single array sorted in non-decreasing order.

The final sorted array should not be returned by the function, but instead be stored inside the array nums1. To accommodate this, nums1 has a length of m + n, where the first m elements denote the elements that should be merged, and the last n elements are set to 0 and should be ignored. nums2 has a length of n.

Example 1:

Input: nums1 = [1,2,3,0,0,0], m = 3, nums2 = [2,5,6], n = 3
Output: [1,2,2,3,5,6]
Explanation: The arrays we are merging are [1,2,3] and [2,5,6].
The result of the merge is [1,2,2,3,5,6] with the underlined elements coming from nums1.

Example 2:

Input: nums1 = [1], m = 1, nums2 = [], n = 0
Output: [1]
Explanation: The arrays we are merging are [1] and [].
The result of the merge is [1].

Example 3:

Input: nums1 = [0], m = 0, nums2 = [1], n = 1
Output: [1]
Explanation: The arrays we are merging are [] and [1].
The result of the merge is [1].
Note that because m = 0, there are no elements in nums1. The 0 is only there to ensure the merge result can fit in nums1.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    void merge(vector<int>& nums1, int m, vector<int>& nums2, int n) {
        // Keep the merged result the empty spaces in nums1 if that is
        // filled then start filling from 0th index in nums2
        for (int i = 0, j = 0, k = m; i < m || j < n;) {
            k = k == m + n ? 0 : k;
            if (i == m) nums1[k++] = nums2[j++];
            else if (j == n) nums1[k++] = nums1[i++];
            else if (nums1[i] <= nums2[j]) nums1[k++] = nums1[i++];
            else nums1[k++] = nums2[j++];
        }
        // By now nums1 will be form, for ex: [3, 4, 5, 1, 2] then shift this
        // array n times
        reverse(nums1.begin(), nums1.end());
        reverse(nums1.begin(), nums1.begin() + n);
        reverse(nums1.begin() + n, nums1.end());
    }
};
```

#### 2. 27. Remove Element
    
Given an integer array nums and an integer val, remove all occurrences of val in nums in-place. The order of the elements may be changed. Then return the number of elements in nums which are not equal to val.

Consider the number of elements in nums which are not equal to val be k, to get accepted, you need to do the following things:

Change the array nums such that the first k elements of nums contain the elements which are not equal to val. The remaining elements of nums are not important as well as the size of nums.
Return k.
Custom Judge:

The judge will test your solution with the following code:

int[] nums = [...]; // Input array
int val = ...; // Value to remove
int[] expectedNums = [...]; // The expected answer with correct length.
                            // It is sorted with no values equaling val.

int k = removeElement(nums, val); // Calls your implementation

assert k == expectedNums.length;
sort(nums, 0, k); // Sort the first k elements of nums
for (int i = 0; i < actualLength; i++) {
    assert nums[i] == expectedNums[i];
}
If all assertions pass, then your solution will be accepted.

Example 1:

Input: nums = [3,2,2,3], val = 3
Output: 2, nums = [2,2,_,_]
Explanation: Your function should return k = 2, with the first two elements of nums being 2.
It does not matter what you leave beyond the returned k (hence they are underscores).
Example 2:

Input: nums = [0,1,2,2,3,0,4,2], val = 2
Output: 5, nums = [0,1,4,0,3,_,_,_]
Explanation: Your function should return k = 5, with the first five elements of nums containing 0, 0, 1, 3, and 4.
Note that the five elements can be returned in any order.
It does not matter what you leave beyond the returned k (hence they are underscores).

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int removeElement(vector<int>& nums, int val) {
        // [i ... j] will contain all the values equal to val
        int i = -1;
        for (int j = 0; j < nums.size(); j++) {
            if (nums[j] != val) {
                swap(nums[i + 1], nums[j]);
                i++;
            }
        }
        return i + 1;
    }
};
```


#### 3. 26. Remove Duplicates from Sorted Array

Given an integer array nums sorted in non-decreasing order, remove the duplicates in-place such that each unique element appears only once. The relative order of the elements should be kept the same. Then return the number of unique elements in nums.

Consider the number of unique elements of nums to be k, to get accepted, you need to do the following things:

Change the array nums such that the first k elements of nums contain the unique elements in the order they were present in nums initially. The remaining elements of nums are not important as well as the size of nums.
Return k.
Custom Judge:

The judge will test your solution with the following code:

int[] nums = [...]; // Input array
int[] expectedNums = [...]; // The expected answer with correct length

int k = removeDuplicates(nums); // Calls your implementation

assert k == expectedNums.length;
for (int i = 0; i < k; i++) {
    assert nums[i] == expectedNums[i];
}
If all assertions pass, then your solution will be accepted.

Example 1:

Input: nums = [1,1,2]
Output: 2, nums = [1,2,_]
Explanation: Your function should return k = 2, with the first two elements of nums being 1 and 2 respectively.
It does not matter what you leave beyond the returned k (hence they are underscores).
Example 2:

Input: nums = [0,0,1,1,1,2,2,3,3,4]
Output: 5, nums = [0,1,2,3,4,_,_,_,_,_]
Explanation: Your function should return k = 5, with the first five elements of nums being 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 respectively.
It does not matter what you leave beyond the returned k (hence they are underscores).

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int removeDuplicates(vector<int>& nums) {
        // [i ... j] contains all the duplicate values
        int i = 0;
        for (int j = 1; j < nums.size(); j++) {
            if (nums[j] != nums[i]) {
                swap(nums[i + 1], nums[j]);
                i++;
            }
        }
        return i + 1;
    }
};
```

#### 4. 80. Remove Duplicates from Sorted Array II

Given an integer array nums sorted in non-decreasing order, remove some duplicates in-place such that each unique element appears at most twice. The relative order of the elements should be kept the same.

Since it is impossible to change the length of the array in some languages, you must instead have the result be placed in the first part of the array nums. More formally, if there are k elements after removing the duplicates, then the first k elements of nums should hold the final result. It does not matter what you leave beyond the first k elements.

Return k after placing the final result in the first k slots of nums.

Do not allocate extra space for another array. You must do this by modifying the input array in-place with O(1) extra memory.

Custom Judge:

The judge will test your solution with the following code:

int[] nums = [...]; // Input array
int[] expectedNums = [...]; // The expected answer with correct length

int k = removeDuplicates(nums); // Calls your implementation

assert k == expectedNums.length;
for (int i = 0; i < k; i++) {
    assert nums[i] == expectedNums[i];
}
If all assertions pass, then your solution will be accepted.

Example 1:

Input: nums = [1,1,1,2,2,3]
Output: 5, nums = [1,1,2,2,3,_]
Explanation: Your function should return k = 5, with the first five elements of nums being 1, 1, 2, 2 and 3 respectively.
It does not matter what you leave beyond the returned k (hence they are underscores).
Example 2:

Input: nums = [0,0,1,1,1,1,2,3,3]
Output: 7, nums = [0,0,1,1,2,3,3,_,_]
Explanation: Your function should return k = 7, with the first seven elements of nums being 0, 0, 1, 1, 2, 3 and 3 respectively.
It does not matter what you leave beyond the returned k (hence they are underscores).

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int removeDuplicates(vector<int>& nums) {
        if (nums.size() <= 2) return nums.size();
        // [i ... j] contains all the values with
        // frequency less than or equal to 2
        int i = 1;
        for (int j = 2; j < nums.size(); j++) {
            if (nums[j] == nums[i] && nums[j] != nums[i - 1]) {
                swap(nums[i + 1], nums[j]);
                i++;
            }
            else if (nums[j] != nums[i]) {
                swap(nums[i + 1], nums[j]);
                i++;
            }
        }
        nums.resize(i + 1);
        return i + 1;  
    }
};
```

#### 5. 169. Majority Element

Given an array nums of size n, return the majority element.

The majority element is the element that appears more than ⌊n / 2⌋ times. You may assume that the majority element always exists in the array.

 

Example 1:

Input: nums = [3,2,3]
Output: 3
Example 2:

Input: nums = [2,2,1,1,1,2,2]
Output: 2

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int majorityElement(vector<int>& nums) {
        // boyer moore algorithm
        int me = INT_MIN, cnt = 0;
        for (const auto& num: nums) {
            cnt += num == me ? 1 : -1;
            if (cnt <= 0) {
                me = num;
                cnt = 1;
            }
        }
        return me;
    }
};
```

#### 6. 189. Rotate Array

Given an integer array nums, rotate the array to the right by k steps, where k is non-negative.

 
Example 1:

Input: nums = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7], k = 3
Output: [5,6,7,1,2,3,4]
Explanation:
rotate 1 steps to the right: [7,1,2,3,4,5,6]
rotate 2 steps to the right: [6,7,1,2,3,4,5]
rotate 3 steps to the right: [5,6,7,1,2,3,4]
Example 2:

Input: nums = [-1,-100,3,99], k = 2
Output: [3,99,-1,-100]
Explanation: 
rotate 1 steps to the right: [99,-1,-100,3]
rotate 2 steps to the right: [3,99,-1,-100]

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    void rotate(vector<int>& nums, int k) {
        reverse(nums.begin(), nums.end());
        reverse(nums.begin(), nums.begin() + k % nums.size());
        reverse(nums.begin() + k % nums.size(), nums.end());
    }
};
```

#### 7. 121. Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock

You are given an array prices where prices[i] is the price of a given stock on the ith day.

You want to maximize your profit by choosing a single day to buy one stock and choosing a different day in the future to sell that stock.

Return the maximum profit you can achieve from this transaction. If you cannot achieve any profit, return 0.


Example 1:

Input: prices = [7,1,5,3,6,4]
Output: 5
Explanation: Buy on day 2 (price = 1) and sell on day 5 (price = 6), profit = 6-1 = 5.
Note that buying on day 2 and selling on day 1 is not allowed because you must buy before you sell.
Example 2:

Input: prices = [7,6,4,3,1]
Output: 0
Explanation: In this case, no transactions are done and the max profit = 0.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int maxProfit(vector<int>& prices) {
        // take minimum price found so far to calcuate 
        // current profit
        int res = 0, mn = prices.front();
        for (const auto& price: prices) {
            res = max(res, price < mn ? 0 : price - mn);
            mn = min(mn, price);
        }
        return res;
    }
};
```

#### 8. 122. Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock II

You are given an integer array prices where prices[i] is the price of a given stock on the ith day.

On each day, you may decide to buy and/or sell the stock. You can only hold at most one share of the stock at any time. However, you can buy it then immediately sell it on the same day.

Find and return the maximum profit you can achieve.


Example 1:

Input: prices = [7,1,5,3,6,4]
Output: 7
Explanation: Buy on day 2 (price = 1) and sell on day 3 (price = 5), profit = 5-1 = 4.
Then buy on day 4 (price = 3) and sell on day 5 (price = 6), profit = 6-3 = 3.
Total profit is 4 + 3 = 7.
Example 2:

Input: prices = [1,2,3,4,5]
Output: 4
Explanation: Buy on day 1 (price = 1) and sell on day 5 (price = 5), profit = 5-1 = 4.
Total profit is 4.
Example 3:

Input: prices = [7,6,4,3,1]
Output: 0
Explanation: There is no way to make a positive profit, so we never buy the stock to achieve the maximum profit of 0.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int maxProfit(vector<int>& prices) {
        int profit = 0;
        for(int i = 1 ;i<prices.size() ;i++){
            if(prices[i-1] < prices[i])
                profit += prices[i] - prices[i-1];
        }
        return profit;
    }
};
```

#### 9. 55. Jump Game

You are given an integer array nums. You are initially positioned at the array's first index, and each element in the array represents your maximum jump length at that position.

Return true if you can reach the last index, or false otherwise.

 
Example 1:

Input: nums = [2,3,1,1,4]
Output: true
Explanation: Jump 1 step from index 0 to 1, then 3 steps to the last index.
Example 2:

Input: nums = [3,2,1,0,4]
Output: false
Explanation: You will always arrive at index 3 no matter what. Its maximum jump length is 0, which makes it impossible to reach the last index.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    bool canJump(vector<int>& nums) {
        int curr = 0, max_so_far = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < nums.size(); i++) {
            max_so_far = max(max_so_far, i + nums[i]);
            if (i == curr) {
                curr = max_so_far;
                max_so_far = 0;
            }
            if (i > curr) return false;
        }
        return true;
    }
};
```

#### 10. 45. Jump Game II

You are given a 0-indexed array of integers nums of length n. You are initially positioned at nums[0].

Each element nums[i] represents the maximum length of a forward jump from index i. In other words, if you are at nums[i], you can jump to any nums[i + j] where:

0 <= j <= nums[i] and
i + j < n
Return the minimum number of jumps to reach nums[n - 1]. The test cases are generated such that you can reach nums[n - 1].

 
Example 1:

Input: nums = [2,3,1,1,4]
Output: 2
Explanation: The minimum number of jumps to reach the last index is 2. Jump 1 step from index 0 to 1, then 3 steps to the last index.
Example 2:

Input: nums = [2,3,0,1,4]
Output: 2

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int jump(vector<int>& nums) {
        if (nums.size() == 1) return 0;
        int res = 0, curr = 0, max_so_far = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < nums.size(); i++) {
            max_so_far = max(max_so_far, i + nums[i]);
            if (i == curr) {
                curr = max_so_far;
                max_so_far = 0;
                if (curr >= nums.size() - 1) return res + 1;
                res++;
            }
        }
        return res;
    }
};
```

#### 11. 274. H-Index

Given an array of integers citations where citations[i] is the number of citations a researcher received for their ith paper, return the researcher's h-index.

According to the definition of h-index on Wikipedia: The h-index is defined as the maximum value of h such that the given researcher has published at least h papers that have each been cited at least h times.


Example 1:

Input: citations = [3,0,6,1,5]
Output: 3
Explanation: [3,0,6,1,5] means the researcher has 5 papers in total and each of them had received 3, 0, 6, 1, 5 citations respectively.
Since the researcher has 3 papers with at least 3 citations each and the remaining two with no more than 3 citations each, their h-index is 3.
Example 2:

Input: citations = [1,3,1]
Output: 1

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int hIndex(vector<int>& citations) {
        sort(citations.begin(), citations.end());
        for (int i = 0; i < citations.size(); i++) {
            if (citations[i] >= citations.size() - i) return citations.size() - i;
        }
        return 0;
    }
};
```

#### 12. 238. Product of Array Except Self

Given an integer array nums, return an array answer such that answer[i] is equal to the product of all the elements of nums except nums[i].

The product of any prefix or suffix of nums is guaranteed to fit in a 32-bit integer.

You must write an algorithm that runs in O(n) time and without using the division operation.


Example 1:

Input: nums = [1,2,3,4]
Output: [24,12,8,6]
Example 2:

Input: nums = [-1,1,0,-3,3]
Output: [0,0,9,0,0]

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> productExceptSelf(vector<int>& nums) {
        vector<int> res(nums.size());
        for (int i = nums.size() - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
            res[i] = nums[i] * (i == nums.size() - 1 ? 1 : res[i + 1]);
        }
        for (int i = 0, l = 1; i < nums.size(); i++) {
            res[i] = l * (i == nums.size() - 1 ? 1 : res[i + 1]);
            l *= nums[i];
        }
        return res;
    }
};
```

#### 13. 380. Insert Delete GetRandom O(1)

Implement the RandomizedSet class:

RandomizedSet() Initializes the RandomizedSet object.
bool insert(int val) Inserts an item val into the set if not present. Returns true if the item was not present, false otherwise.
bool remove(int val) Removes an item val from the set if present. Returns true if the item was present, false otherwise.
int getRandom() Returns a random element from the current set of elements (it's guaranteed that at least one element exists when this method is called). Each element must have the same probability of being returned.
You must implement the functions of the class such that each function works in average O(1) time complexity.
 

Example 1:

Input
["RandomizedSet", "insert", "remove", "insert", "getRandom", "remove", "insert", "getRandom"]
[[], [1], [2], [2], [], [1], [2], []]
Output
[null, true, false, true, 2, true, false, 2]

Explanation
RandomizedSet randomizedSet = new RandomizedSet();
randomizedSet.insert(1); // Inserts 1 to the set. Returns true as 1 was inserted successfully.
randomizedSet.remove(2); // Returns false as 2 does not exist in the set.
randomizedSet.insert(2); // Inserts 2 to the set, returns true. Set now contains [1,2].
randomizedSet.getRandom(); // getRandom() should return either 1 or 2 randomly.
randomizedSet.remove(1); // Removes 1 from the set, returns true. Set now contains [2].
randomizedSet.insert(2); // 2 was already in the set, so return false.
randomizedSet.getRandom(); // Since 2 is the only number in the set, getRandom() will always return 2.

```cpp
class RandomizedSet {
private:
    unordered_map<int, int> mp;
    vector<int> st;

public:
    RandomizedSet() {
        
    }
    
    bool insert(int val) {
        if (mp.find(val) != mp.end()) return false;
        mp[val] = st.size();
        st.push_back(val);
        return true;
    }
    
    bool remove(int val) {
        // swap the last element with the element 
        // to be deleted and delete the last element
        if (mp.find(val) != mp.end()) {
            mp[st.back()] = mp[val];
            st[mp[val]] = st.back();
            mp.erase(mp.find(val));
            st.pop_back();
            return true;
        }
        return false;
    }
    
    int getRandom() {
        return st[rand() % st.size()];
    }
};

/**
 * Your RandomizedSet object will be instantiated and called as such:
 * RandomizedSet* obj = new RandomizedSet();
 * bool param_1 = obj->insert(val);
 * bool param_2 = obj->remove(val);
 * int param_3 = obj->getRandom();
 */
```

#### 14. 134. Gas Station

There are n gas stations along a circular route, where the amount of gas at the ith station is gas[i].

You have a car with an unlimited gas tank and it costs cost[i] of gas to travel from the ith station to its next (i + 1)th station. You begin the journey with an empty tank at one of the gas stations.

Given two integer arrays gas and cost, return the starting gas station's index if you can travel around the circuit once in the clockwise direction, otherwise return -1. If there exists a solution, it is guaranteed to be unique.


Example 1:

Input: gas = [1,2,3,4,5], cost = [3,4,5,1,2]
Output: 3
Explanation:
Start at station 3 (index 3) and fill up with 4 unit of gas. Your tank = 0 + 4 = 4
Travel to station 4. Your tank = 4 - 1 + 5 = 8
Travel to station 0. Your tank = 8 - 2 + 1 = 7
Travel to station 1. Your tank = 7 - 3 + 2 = 6
Travel to station 2. Your tank = 6 - 4 + 3 = 5
Travel to station 3. The cost is 5. Your gas is just enough to travel back to station 3.
Therefore, return 3 as the starting index.
Example 2:

Input: gas = [2,3,4], cost = [3,4,3]
Output: -1
Explanation:
You can't start at station 0 or 1, as there is not enough gas to travel to the next station.
Let's start at station 2 and fill up with 4 unit of gas. Your tank = 0 + 4 = 4
Travel to station 0. Your tank = 4 - 3 + 2 = 3
Travel to station 1. Your tank = 3 - 3 + 3 = 3
You cannot travel back to station 2, as it requires 4 unit of gas but you only have 3.
Therefore, you can't travel around the circuit once no matter where you start.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int canCompleteCircuit(vector<int>& gas, vector<int>& cost) {
        int n = gas.size();
        int total_surplus = 0; // it will give us a difference b/w gas & cost
        int surplus = 0;       // our tank
        int start = 0;         // and the index of gas station

        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            total_surplus += gas[i] - cost[i];
            surplus += gas[i] - cost[i];
            if (surplus < 0) { // if the tank goes -ve
                surplus = 0;   // reset our tank
                start = i + 1; // and update the stating gas station
            }
        }
        return (total_surplus < 0) ? -1 : start;
    }
};
```

#### 15. 135. Candy

There are n children standing in a line. Each child is assigned a rating value given in the integer array ratings.

You are giving candies to these children subjected to the following requirements:

Each child must have at least one candy.
Children with a higher rating get more candies than their neighbors.
Return the minimum number of candies you need to have to distribute the candies to the children.

 
Example 1:

Input: ratings = [1,0,2]
Output: 5
Explanation: You can allocate to the first, second and third child with 2, 1, 2 candies respectively.
Example 2:

Input: ratings = [1,2,2]
Output: 4
Explanation: You can allocate to the first, second and third child with 1, 2, 1 candies respectively.
The third child gets 1 candy because it satisfies the above two conditions.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int candy(vector<int>& ratings) {
        vector<int> cnd(ratings.size());
        vector<pair<int, int>> ri;
        for (int i = 0; i < ratings.size(); i++) ri.push_back({ratings[i], i});
        sort(ri.begin(), ri.end());
        // Iterate through ratings with smaller ratings first as if its neighbours
        // is less than the current, it should be more than their candy
        for (const auto& [rating, idx]: ri) {
            if (idx - 1 >= 0 && ratings[idx - 1] < ratings[idx]) {
                cnd[idx] = cnd[idx - 1] + 1;
            }
            if (idx + 1 < ratings.size() && ratings[idx + 1] < ratings[idx]) {
                cnd[idx] = max(cnd[idx], cnd[idx + 1] + 1);
            }
            if (cnd[idx] == 0) {
                cnd[idx] = 1;
            }
        }
        return accumulate(cnd.begin(), cnd.end(), 0L);
    }
};
```

#### 16. 42. Trapping Rain Water

Given n non-negative integers representing an elevation map where the width of each bar is 1, compute how much water it can trap after raining.
 

Example 1:


Input: height = [0,1,0,2,1,0,1,3,2,1,2,1]
Output: 6
Explanation: The above elevation map (black section) is represented by array [0,1,0,2,1,0,1,3,2,1,2,1]. In this case, 6 units of rain water (blue section) are being trapped.
Example 2:

Input: height = [4,2,0,3,2,5]
Output: 9

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int trap(vector<int>& height) {
        int n = height.size();
        vector<int> leftMax(n), rightMax(n);
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            leftMax[i] = i == 0 ? height[i] : max(leftMax[i - 1], height[i]);
        }
        for (int i = n - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
            rightMax[i] = i == n - 1 ? height[i] : max(rightMax[i + 1], height[i]);
        }
        int ans = 0;
        for (int i = 1; i < n - 1; i++) {
            int currMax = min(leftMax[i - 1], rightMax[i + 1]);
            if (currMax >= height[i]) ans += currMax - height[i];
        }
        return ans;
    }
};
```

#### 17. 13. Roman to Integer

Roman numerals are represented by seven different symbols: I, V, X, L, C, D and M.

Symbol       Value
I             1
V             5
X             10
L             50
C             100
D             500
M             1000
For example, 2 is written as II in Roman numeral, just two ones added together. 12 is written as XII, which is simply X + II. The number 27 is written as XXVII, which is XX + V + II.

Roman numerals are usually written largest to smallest from left to right. However, the numeral for four is not IIII. Instead, the number four is written as IV. Because the one is before the five we subtract it making four. The same principle applies to the number nine, which is written as IX. There are six instances where subtraction is used:

I can be placed before V (5) and X (10) to make 4 and 9. 
X can be placed before L (50) and C (100) to make 40 and 90. 
C can be placed before D (500) and M (1000) to make 400 and 900.
Given a roman numeral, convert it to an integer.

 

Example 1:

Input: s = "III"
Output: 3
Explanation: III = 3.
Example 2:

Input: s = "LVIII"
Output: 58
Explanation: L = 50, V= 5, III = 3.
Example 3:

Input: s = "MCMXCIV"
Output: 1994
Explanation: M = 1000, CM = 900, XC = 90 and IV = 4.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int char2num(char a) {
        switch (a) {
            case 'I': return 1;
            case 'V': return 5;
            case 'X': return 10;
            case 'L': return 50;
            case 'C': return 100;
            case 'D': return 500;
            case 'M': return 1000;
            default: return 0;
        }
    }

    int romanToInt(string s) {
        int result = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < s.length(); i++) {
            if (i + 1 < s.length() && char2num(s[i]) < char2num(s[i + 1])) {
                result -= char2num(s[i]);
            } else {
                result += char2num(s[i]);
            }
        }
        return result;
    }
};
```

#### 18. 12. Integer to Roman

Seven different symbols represent Roman numerals with the following values:

Symbol	Value
I	1
V	5
X	10
L	50
C	100
D	500
M	1000
Roman numerals are formed by appending the conversions of decimal place values from highest to lowest. Converting a decimal place value into a Roman numeral has the following rules:

If the value does not start with 4 or 9, select the symbol of the maximal value that can be subtracted from the input, append that symbol to the result, subtract its value, and convert the remainder to a Roman numeral.
If the value starts with 4 or 9 use the subtractive form representing one symbol subtracted from the following symbol, for example, 4 is 1 (I) less than 5 (V): IV and 9 is 1 (I) less than 10 (X): IX. Only the following subtractive forms are used: 4 (IV), 9 (IX), 40 (XL), 90 (XC), 400 (CD) and 900 (CM).
Only powers of 10 (I, X, C, M) can be appended consecutively at most 3 times to represent multiples of 10. You cannot append 5 (V), 50 (L), or 500 (D) multiple times. If you need to append a symbol 4 times use the subtractive form.
Given an integer, convert it to a Roman numeral.

 

Example 1:

Input: num = 3749

Output: "MMMDCCXLIX"

Explanation:

3000 = MMM as 1000 (M) + 1000 (M) + 1000 (M)
 700 = DCC as 500 (D) + 100 (C) + 100 (C)
  40 = XL as 10 (X) less of 50 (L)
   9 = IX as 1 (I) less of 10 (X)
Note: 49 is not 1 (I) less of 50 (L) because the conversion is based on decimal places
Example 2:

Input: num = 58

Output: "LVIII"

Explanation:

50 = L
 8 = VIII
Example 3:

Input: num = 1994

Output: "MCMXCIV"

Explanation:

1000 = M
 900 = CM
  90 = XC
   4 = IV

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    string intToRoman(int num) {
        string ones[] = {"","I","II","III","IV","V","VI","VII","VIII","IX"};
        string tens[] = {"","X","XX","XXX","XL","L","LX","LXX","LXXX","XC"};
        string hrns[] = {"","C","CC","CCC","CD","D","DC","DCC","DCCC","CM"};
        string ths[]={"","M","MM","MMM"};
        
        return ths[num/1000] + hrns[(num%1000)/100] + tens[(num%100)/10] + ones[num%10];
    }
};
```

#### 19. 58. Length of Last Word

Given a string s consisting of words and spaces, return the length of the last word in the string.

A word is a maximal 
substring
 consisting of non-space characters only.


Example 1:

Input: s = "Hello World"
Output: 5
Explanation: The last word is "World" with length 5.
Example 2:

Input: s = "   fly me   to   the moon  "
Output: 4
Explanation: The last word is "moon" with length 4.
Example 3:

Input: s = "luffy is still joyboy"
Output: 6
Explanation: The last word is "joyboy" with length 6.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int lengthOfLastWord(string s) {
       istringstream is(s);
       string word;
       int res = 0;
       while (is >> word) res = word.size();
       return res; 
    }
};
```

#### 20. 14. Longest Common Prefix

Write a function to find the longest common prefix string amongst an array of strings.

If there is no common prefix, return an empty string "".


Example 1:

Input: strs = ["flower","flow","flight"]
Output: "fl"
Example 2:

Input: strs = ["dog","racecar","car"]
Output: ""
Explanation: There is no common prefix among the input strings.
 
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    string longestCommonPrefix(vector<string>& strs) {
        string res;
        while (true) {
            if (res.size() == strs.front().size()) return res;
            char ch = strs.front()[res.size()];
            for (const auto& str: strs) {
                if (str.size() < res.size()) return res;
                if (str[res.size()] != ch) return res;
            }
            res.push_back(ch);
        }
        return "";
    }
};
```

#### 21. 151. Reverse Words in a String

Given an input string s, reverse the order of the words.

A word is defined as a sequence of non-space characters. The words in s will be separated by at least one space.

Return a string of the words in reverse order concatenated by a single space.

Note that s may contain leading or trailing spaces or multiple spaces between two words. The returned string should only have a single space separating the words. Do not include any extra spaces.

Example 1:

Input: s = "the sky is blue"
Output: "blue is sky the"
Example 2:

Input: s = "  hello world  "
Output: "world hello"
Explanation: Your reversed string should not contain leading or trailing spaces.
Example 3:

Input: s = "a good   example"
Output: "example good a"
Explanation: You need to reduce multiple spaces between two words to a single space in the reversed string.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    string reverseWords(string s) {
        // make the string evenly spaced with one space between two words
        for (int i = 0, j = 0; j < s.size(); j++) {
            if (s[j] != ' ') {
                if (i == j) i++;
                else {
                    s[i++] = s[j];
                    s[j] = ' '; 
                }
            }
            else {
                if (i == 0 || s[i - 1] == ' ') continue;
                else s[i++] = ' ';
            }
        }
        // erase the remaining spaces at the end
        s.erase(find_if(s.rbegin(), s.rend(), [](unsigned char ch) {
            return !isspace(ch);
        }).base(), s.end());
        // reverse the whole string
        reverse(s.begin(), s.end());
        // reverse the individual words
        for (auto prev = s.begin(), it = s.begin(); it != s.end(); it++) {
            if (*it == ' ') {
                reverse(prev, it);
                prev = it + 1;
            }
            if (it + 1 == s.end()) reverse(prev, s.end());
        }
        return s;
    }
};
```

#### 22. 6. Zigzag Conversion

The string "PAYPALISHIRING" is written in a zigzag pattern on a given number of rows like this: (you may want to display this pattern in a fixed font for better legibility)

P   A   H   N
A P L S I I G
Y   I   R
And then read line by line: "PAHNAPLSIIGYIR"

Write the code that will take a string and make this conversion given a number of rows:

string convert(string s, int numRows);
 

Example 1:

Input: s = "PAYPALISHIRING", numRows = 3
Output: "PAHNAPLSIIGYIR"
Example 2:

Input: s = "PAYPALISHIRING", numRows = 4
Output: "PINALSIGYAHRPI"
Explanation:
P     I    N
A   L S  I G
Y A   H R
P     I
Example 3:

Input: s = "A", numRows = 1
Output: "A"

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    string convert(string s, int numRows) {
        if (numRows <= 1) return s;
        vector<string> mat(numRows, "");
        int j = 0, dir = -1;
        for (int i = 0; i < s.length(); i++) {
            if (j == numRows - 1 || j == 0) dir *= (-1);
            mat[j] += s[i];
            if (dir == 1) j++;
            else j--;
        }
        string res;
        for (auto& it : mat) res += it;
        return res;
    }
};
```


#### 23. 28. Find the Index of the First Occurrence in a String

Given two strings needle and haystack, return the index of the first occurrence of needle in haystack, or -1 if needle is not part of haystack.
 

Example 1:

Input: haystack = "sadbutsad", needle = "sad"
Output: 0
Explanation: "sad" occurs at index 0 and 6.
The first occurrence is at index 0, so we return 0.
Example 2:

Input: haystack = "leetcode", needle = "leeto"
Output: -1
Explanation: "leeto" did not occur in "leetcode", so we return -1.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int strStr(string haystack, string needle) {
        return haystack.find(needle);
    }
};
```

#### 24. 68. Text Justification
Hard
Topics
Companies
Given an array of strings words and a width maxWidth, format the text such that each line has exactly maxWidth characters and is fully (left and right) justified.

You should pack your words in a greedy approach; that is, pack as many words as you can in each line. Pad extra spaces ' ' when necessary so that each line has exactly maxWidth characters.

Extra spaces between words should be distributed as evenly as possible. If the number of spaces on a line does not divide evenly between words, the empty slots on the left will be assigned more spaces than the slots on the right.

For the last line of text, it should be left-justified, and no extra space is inserted between words.

Note:

A word is defined as a character sequence consisting of non-space characters only.
Each word's length is guaranteed to be greater than 0 and not exceed maxWidth.
The input array words contains at least one word.
 

Example 1:

Input: words = ["This", "is", "an", "example", "of", "text", "justification."], maxWidth = 16
Output:
[
   "This    is    an",
   "example  of text",
   "justification.  "
]
Example 2:

Input: words = ["What","must","be","acknowledgment","shall","be"], maxWidth = 16
Output:
[
  "What   must   be",
  "acknowledgment  ",
  "shall be        "
]
Explanation: Note that the last line is "shall be    " instead of "shall     be", because the last line must be left-justified instead of fully-justified.
Note that the second line is also left-justified because it contains only one word.
Example 3:

Input: words = ["Science","is","what","we","understand","well","enough","to","explain","to","a","computer.","Art","is","everything","else","we","do"], maxWidth = 20
Output:
[
  "Science  is  what we",
  "understand      well",
  "enough to explain to",
  "a  computer.  Art is",
  "everything  else  we",
  "do                  "
]

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    vector<string> fullJustify(vector<string>& words, int maxWidth) {
        vector<string> result;
        int n = words.size();
        int index = 0;

        while (index < n) {
            int totalChars = words[index].size();
            int last = index + 1;

            while (last < n && totalChars + words[last].size() + (last - index) <= maxWidth) {
                totalChars += words[last].size();
                last++;
            }

            string line;
            int gaps = last - index - 1;

            if (last == n || gaps == 0) {
                for (int i = index; i < last; i++) {
                    line += words[i];
                    if (i < last - 1) line += " ";
                }
                line += string(maxWidth - line.size(), ' ');
            } else {
                int spaces = (maxWidth - totalChars) / gaps;
                int extraSpaces = (maxWidth - totalChars) % gaps;

                for (int i = index; i < last - 1; i++) {
                    line += words[i];
                    line += string(spaces + (i - index < extraSpaces ? 1 : 0), ' ');
                }
                line += words[last - 1];
            }

            result.push_back(line);
            index = last;
        }

        return result;
    }
};
```

#### 25. 125. Valid Palindrome

A phrase is a palindrome if, after converting all uppercase letters into lowercase letters and removing all non-alphanumeric characters, it reads the same forward and backward. Alphanumeric characters include letters and numbers.

Given a string s, return true if it is a palindrome, or false otherwise.

Example 1:

Input: s = "A man, a plan, a canal: Panama"
Output: true
Explanation: "amanaplanacanalpanama" is a palindrome.
Example 2:

Input: s = "race a car"
Output: false
Explanation: "raceacar" is not a palindrome.
Example 3:

Input: s = " "
Output: true
Explanation: s is an empty string "" after removing non-alphanumeric characters.
Since an empty string reads the same forward and backward, it is a palindrome.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    bool isAlpha(const char& ch) {
        return !((ch >= 'a' && ch <= 'z') || (ch >= 'A' && ch <= 'Z') || (ch >= '0' && ch <= '9'));
    }

    bool isPalindrome(string s) {
        for (int i = 0, j = s.size() - 1; i < j;) {
            if (!isAlpha(s[i]) && !isAlpha(s[j])) {
                if (tolower(s[i]) != tolower(s[j])) return false;
                i++;
                j--;
            }
            else if (isAlpha(s[i])) i++;
            else if (isAlpha(s[j])) j--;
        }
        return true;
    }
};
```

#### 26. 392. Is Subsequence

Given two strings s and t, return true if s is a subsequence of t, or false otherwise.

A subsequence of a string is a new string that is formed from the original string by deleting some (can be none) of the characters without disturbing the relative positions of the remaining characters. (i.e., "ace" is a subsequence of "abcde" while "aec" is not).
 

Example 1:

Input: s = "abc", t = "ahbgdc"
Output: true
Example 2:

Input: s = "axc", t = "ahbgdc"
Output: false

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    bool isSubsequence(string s, string t) {
        if (s.empty()) return true;
        for (int i = 0, j = 0; i < s.size() && j < t.size(); j++) {
            if (s[i] == t[j]) i++;
            if (i == s.size()) return true;
        }
        return false;
    }
};
```

#### 27. 167. Two Sum II - Input Array Is Sorted

Given a 1-indexed array of integers numbers that is already sorted in non-decreasing order, find two numbers such that they add up to a specific target number. Let these two numbers be numbers[index1] and numbers[index2] where 1 <= index1 < index2 <= numbers.length.

Return the indices of the two numbers, index1 and index2, added by one as an integer array [index1, index2] of length 2.

The tests are generated such that there is exactly one solution. You may not use the same element twice.

Your solution must use only constant extra space.

Example 1:

Input: numbers = [2,7,11,15], target = 9
Output: [1,2]
Explanation: The sum of 2 and 7 is 9. Therefore, index1 = 1, index2 = 2. We return [1, 2].
Example 2:

Input: numbers = [2,3,4], target = 6
Output: [1,3]
Explanation: The sum of 2 and 4 is 6. Therefore index1 = 1, index2 = 3. We return [1, 3].
Example 3:

Input: numbers = [-1,0], target = -1
Output: [1,2]
Explanation: The sum of -1 and 0 is -1. Therefore index1 = 1, index2 = 2. We return [1, 2].

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> twoSum(vector<int>& numbers, int target) {
        for (int i = 0, j = numbers.size() - 1; i < j;) {
            if (numbers[i] + numbers[j] == target) return {i + 1, j + 1};
            else if (numbers[i] + numbers[j] > target) j--;
            else i++;
        }
        return {-1, -1};
    }
};
```


#### 28. 11. Container With Most Water

You are given an integer array height of length n. There are n vertical lines drawn such that the two endpoints of the ith line are (i, 0) and (i, height[i]).

Find two lines that together with the x-axis form a container, such that the container contains the most water.

Return the maximum amount of water a container can store.

Notice that you may not slant the container.
 

Example 1:

Input: height = [1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7]
Output: 49
Explanation: The above vertical lines are represented by array [1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7]. In this case, the max area of water (blue section) the container can contain is 49.
Example 2:

Input: height = [1,1]
Output: 1

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int maxArea(vector<int>& height) {
        int res = 0;
        for (int i = 0, j = height.size() - 1; i < j;) {
            res = max(res, min(height[i], height[j]) * (j - i));
            if (height[i] < height[j]) i++;
            else j--;
        }
        return res;
    }
};
```

#### 29. 15. 3Sum

Given an integer array nums, return all the triplets [nums[i], nums[j], nums[k]] such that i != j, i != k, and j != k, and nums[i] + nums[j] + nums[k] == 0.

Notice that the solution set must not contain duplicate triplets.

Example 1:

Input: nums = [-1,0,1,2,-1,-4]
Output: [[-1,-1,2],[-1,0,1]]
Explanation: 
nums[0] + nums[1] + nums[2] = (-1) + 0 + 1 = 0.
nums[1] + nums[2] + nums[4] = 0 + 1 + (-1) = 0.
nums[0] + nums[3] + nums[4] = (-1) + 2 + (-1) = 0.
The distinct triplets are [-1,0,1] and [-1,-1,2].
Notice that the order of the output and the order of the triplets does not matter.
Example 2:

Input: nums = [0,1,1]
Output: []
Explanation: The only possible triplet does not sum up to 0.
Example 3:

Input: nums = [0,0,0]
Output: [[0,0,0]]
Explanation: The only possible triplet sums up to 0.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    vector<vector<int>> threeSum(vector<int>& nums) {
        multiset<int> st(nums.begin(), nums.end());
        set<vector<int>> res;
        sort(nums.begin(), nums.end());
        st.erase(st.find(nums.front()));
        for (int j = 1; j < nums.size(); j++) {
            st.erase(st.find(nums[j]));
            for (int i = 0; i < j; i++) {
                if (st.find(-1 * (nums[i] + nums[j])) != st.end()) {
                    res.insert({nums[i], nums[j], -1 * (nums[i] + nums[j])});
                }
            }
        }
        return vector<vector<int>>(res.begin(), res.end());
    }
};
```

#### 30. 209. Minimum Size Subarray Sum

Given an array of positive integers nums and a positive integer target, return the minimal length of a 
subarray
 whose sum is greater than or equal to target. If there is no such subarray, return 0 instead.

Example 1:

Input: target = 7, nums = [2,3,1,2,4,3]
Output: 2
Explanation: The subarray [4,3] has the minimal length under the problem constraint.
Example 2:

Input: target = 4, nums = [1,4,4]
Output: 1
Example 3:

Input: target = 11, nums = [1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1]
Output: 0

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int minSubArrayLen(int target, vector<int>& nums) {
        int res = INT_MAX;
        for (int i = 0, j = 0, curr = 0; j < nums.size(); j++) {
            curr += nums[j];
            while (curr >= target) {
                curr -= nums[i];
                res = min(res, j - i + 1);
                i++;
            }
        }
        return res == INT_MAX ? 0 : res;
    }
};
```

#### 31. 3. Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters

Given a string s, find the length of the longest 
substring
 without repeating characters. 

Example 1:

Input: s = "abcabcbb"
Output: 3
Explanation: The answer is "abc", with the length of 3.
Example 2:

Input: s = "bbbbb"
Output: 1
Explanation: The answer is "b", with the length of 1.
Example 3:

Input: s = "pwwkew"
Output: 3
Explanation: The answer is "wke", with the length of 3.
Notice that the answer must be a substring, "pwke" is a subsequence and not a substring.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int lengthOfLongestSubstring(string s) {
        int res = 0;
        set<char> st;
        for (int i = 0, j = 0; j < s.size(); j++) {
            if (st.find(s[j]) != st.end()) {
                while (s[i] != s[j]) {
                    st.erase(st.find(s[i++]));
                }
                i++;
            }
            st.insert(s[j]);
            res = max(res, j - i + 1);
        }
        return res;
    }
};
```
